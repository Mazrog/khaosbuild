Install TXT
===========

You can launch the install.sh script directly, that will go through required steps to setup the environment, or do it manually by following the instructions below.

Manual:
---
Tools are developped with python 3.

- install pip
- install virtualenv
$ sudo apt install python3-venv

Create a source directory
$ python3 -m venv sandbox
# sandbox will be the directory created by virtualenv

Start the virtual environment
$ source sandbox/bin/activate

Upgrade pip if needed
$ pip install --upgrade pip

Install Click
$ pip install click

Installing python-dotenv to read env files
$ pip install python-dotenv

Install khabuild tool
$ pip install --editable tools/khabuild

Install is over, you can manually deactivate the virtual env

$ source shell.sh
